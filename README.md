# MSCI 121
## Personality Test Assignment
This repository contains my work on an assignment from MSCI 121: Introduction to Computer Programming. <br>
The goal of the assignment was to analyze a personality test answer file to determine the Myers-Briggs personality type. <br>
A sample test output file was provided (personality.txt) along with the test questions (survey.txt). <br> 
PersonalityTest.java was the required assignment code; it simply analyzes the test answer file. <br>
PersonalityTestSurvey.java was a personal extension to the assignment allowing a user to take the test and immediately receive their results. <br>
